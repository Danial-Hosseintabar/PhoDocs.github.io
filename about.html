            <h1>Danial Hosseintabar(author and web-developer):</h1> My name is Danial Hosseintabar. I am won IPhO silver
            medal in 2022 and bronze medal in APhO 2022. After I finished Olympiad, I started teaching olympiad in
            highschools along my university. I study Computer Science in Sharif University of Technology, which
            describes makes it easy to realise that I am also obsesed with technology. I have been wanting to create a
            website to share interesting things about physics olympiad that I had learned through lots experience and
            problem solvings, therefore I created it. Since I am very busy with my university schedules and can not
            complete it on my own, I decided to get help from one of my best friends Sadra Hosseini (Silver medalist of
            IPhO 2022, Bronze medalist of APhO 2022), a very knowledgable and creative person which really suits to be
            an author. <br /><br /><br />
